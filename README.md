# Simple-Pong
Welcome to the Simple Pong Game project! This Java-based implementation of the classic Pong game allows two players to control paddles using different keys (W/S for Player 1, Up/Down arrows for Player 2). The game continues until one player scores 5 points, then stops and declares the winner. Enjoy and contribute!
